short_description=Restrict guilds, channels or users from using the bot.
run_add=Adds an ID to the blacklist. The ID may refer to a guild, a guild channel or a user in Discord. If someone attempts to run a command while their ID or the ID of the guild/channel they're using the command in is blacklisted, the command will be ignored without any side effect. This command is useful to handle cases of abuse.
run_remove=Removes an ID from the blacklist. Once an ID is removed from the blacklist, the user/channel/guild in question will be able to run bot commands again normally.
