short_description=Provides documentation for all commands.
run=If used without arguments, this command will display the list of all commands that you can use in the current channel.\n\
If `command` is specified, it will display information on the command, such as its syntax, the flags available, and a detailed description of what it does. Each command may have one or several subcommands, each of them with their own documentation. For such commands, you can specify which subcommand you want to get info on via the second `subcommand` argument.
